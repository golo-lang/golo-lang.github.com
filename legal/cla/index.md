### Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in Golo!

Before we can accept any contribution from you and/or your company, we need that you sign a
contributor license agreement with [INSA-Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/).

INSA-Lyon is a public french engineering school / university.
The [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) is a public research laboratory from INSA-Lyon.

We do not want to take anything away from you, and we have no evil plans in mind.

Simply put, a contributor license agreement clarifies the legal implications of your contribution,
and provides safety guards for both you and us.

Our contributor license agreement is an adaptation of
[the one from the Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/licenses/):

- [French version](CLA-Golo-FR.pdf)
- [English version](CLA-Golo-EN.pdf)

You can sign either version and send a PDF scan to
[julien.ponge@insa-lyon.fr](mailto:julien.ponge@insa-lyon.fr).
You may send questions to that address, too.
