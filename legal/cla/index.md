# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in Golo!

Before we can accept any contribution from you and/or your company, we need that you sign a
contributor license agreement with INSA-Lyon.

INSA-Lyon is a public french engineering school / university. The CITI Laboratory is a public
research laboratory from INSA-Lyon, with an affiliation with INRIA.

We do not want to take anything away from you, and we have no evil plans in mind.

Simply put, a contributor license agreement clarifies the legal implications of your contribution,
and provides safety guards for both you and us.

Our contributor license agreement is an adaptation of the one from the Apache Software Foundation:

- [CLA-Golo-FR.pdf](French version)
- [CLA-Golo-EN.pdf](English version)

You can sign either version and send a PDF scan to
[mailto:julien.ponge@insa-lyon.fr](julien.ponge@insa-lyon.fr).
You may send questions to that address, too.
