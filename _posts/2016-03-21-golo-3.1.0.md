It is a great pleasure for us to announce both the release of Eclipse Golo 3.1.0 _and_ the graduation of the
project from the Eclipse incubator. This means that Golo is now a _mature_ Eclipse Technology Project!

Many, many, many thanks to [everyone who has contributed to  Golo](https://github.com/eclipse/golo-lang/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS)!

### What's new

Here is a quick recap of the 2 milestones that led to this release.

#### 3.1.0-incubation-M1 (2016/01/14)

* The new `gololang.Errors` modules provides functional error handling capabilities.
* An issue with named parameters and directly-called anonymous function references has been fixed.
* Duplicate `struct` and `union` types are now being detected as compilation errors.
* The `orIfNull` operator was incorrectly eager, it has now been made lazy.
* Overloaded instance methods from Java APIs are now supported, with proper call site invalidation. This augments the Golo to Java inter-operability.
* The runtime support for instance methods resolution has been refactored.
* A rare variable arguments matching issue has been fixed.
* Augmentations are now also resolved based on the call stack, so that a calling module also offers its visible augmentations as a fallback.
* Operator call sites now use an exception-based invalidation mechanism rather that a guard-based one.
* Structures are now comparable.
* Issues when mixing module state and closure state have been addressed.
* A new console ANSI codes module is part of the standard API.
* Custom factory functions can now be defined for structures.
* Implicit modules are now imported after the explicit ones.
* The compiler intermediate representation API has been refactored.

#### 3.1.0-M2 (2016/03/02)

* Property-style methods support.
* The Golo documentation now embeds _highlight.js_ to properly color Golo code snippets.
* The `golo compile` command can now directly output to a JAR archive.
* The `Predefined.fun` function has been improved for variable-arity resolutions as well as supporting resolution from current imports.
* The new `gololang.Functions` module provides functions, higher order functions and decorators to support well-known idioms of functional programming.
* New syntax to specify arity in function literals.
* Docker image fixes.
* Misc. bugs have been resolved.
