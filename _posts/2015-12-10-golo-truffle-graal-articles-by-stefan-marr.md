title: "Golo Truffle/Graal articles by Stefan Marr"
---

[Dr Stefan Marr](http://stefan-marr.de/) recently published a series of blog posts to explain how
to use [Truffle](https://github.com/OracleLabs/Truffle) and the
[Graal VM](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/) to implement and run programming languages.
Stefan is working at the [Institute for System Software](http://ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/) at the Johannes
Kepler University, Linz, Austria. Prior to that, Stefan was a post-doctoral fellow at
INRIA Lille, France.

Stefan used [Eclipse Golo](http://golo-lang.org/) as the support language to explain how to design
interpreters with Truffle, and the outcome in terms of peak performance is rather impressive!
