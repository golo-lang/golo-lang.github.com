Our *awesome* Golo Developer Advocate Philippe Charri√®re did a 2 hours long talk at the
[Montpellier JUG June 2013 session](http://www.jug-montpellier.org/).

Philippe is a sales guy with curriculum consisting of a mixture of business and IT courses. Still,
he is a self-taught geek who codes a lot on the side to change his mind from Word, Excel and
PowerPoint. You can see him playing with web frameworks, a Raspberry Pi, or controlling a copter
drone from his phone.

People like Philippe bring us back to sometimes forgotten values of the free software and opensource
movements: sharing knowledge, seeing each others as peers rather than producer-consumers, and...
**having fun in the most disinterested manner**.

His enthusiasm for Golo is especially touching for us academics, as it shows that what we do can go
beyond papers, prototypes and classic industry transfer. That alone is a good enough justification
for making Golo, a simple and approachable language for the JVM.
