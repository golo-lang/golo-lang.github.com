We are pleased to share the third and last milestone towards Golo 3.0.0.

### What's new?

This milestone brings the last touches before we step into preparing an official release at the
Eclipse Foundation:

* Refactoring from `fr.insalyon.citi.golo` to `org.eclipse.golo` packages.
* FindBugs integration in the build process.
* Fixes have been applied to address the relevant FindBugs reports, and unappropriated ones have been silenced.
* Parser error traces have been simplified to avoid confusion.
* Misc fixes.

### What's next?

The `versions/3.0` branch will host the preparations towards Golo 3.0.0 as well as potential 3.0.x
service releases.

The `master` branch is now pointing to the development of Golo 3.1.

A release and IP review has been started at the Eclipse Foundation. If everything goes well we will
announce an official release in the next few weeks!
