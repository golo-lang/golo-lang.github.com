We are pleased to share the second milestone towards Golo 3.0.0.

Sticking to [our roadmap](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Golo/Roadmap-v3.0), we will make a new
milestone available every 6 weeks.

### What's new?

* Collection comprehensions, inspired by Python.
* The documentation is now generated with AsciiDoctor instead of AsciiDoc.
* Union types now have special methods synthesized from members to facilitate tests.
* The build has been migrated from Maven to Gradle.
* `reversed_range` has been renamed to `reversedRange` for consistency reasons.
* The new `box(obj)` predefined function boxes an object reference into a `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`. This is useful to inject mutable state into closures.

The highlight of this milestone is clearly the new collection comprehensions contributed by Yannick Loiseau.
You can now turn code like:

{% highlight golo %}
let l = list[]
foreach x in [1..4] {
  foreach y in ["a", "b", "c"] {
    l: add([x, y])
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

into:

{% highlight golo %}
let l = list[ [x, y] foreach x in [1..4] foreach y in ["a", "b", "c"] ]
{% endhighlight %}
