We are glad to present you with the third milestone of Golo 3.2.0!

### What's new

OSGi metadata is back, and we can now run Golo as _shebang_-style scripts:

* OSGi metadata is now generated again (using the corresponding Gradle plugin).
* New shebang runtime support for running Golo as scripts.

Here is how you could run a Golo script:

```golo
#!/usr/bin/env golosh
module hello

function main = |args| {
  require(args: length() > 1, "You should set at least one argument!")
  println("Hello " + args: get(1) + " from '" + args: get(0) + "'!")
}
```

Note that this new feature contributed by Sylvain Desgrais offers automatic loading of `.jar` and `.golo` files from the current directory and nested sub-directories, so you don't even have to specify any kind of classpath.
