### What's new

* Multiple imports from the same statement, as in `import java.util.{Collections, Objects, stream.Collectors}`.
* Relative imports from the current module, as in `import .bar.Baz`.
* Misc improvements of the struct generated classes.
* Localisation in the compiler, CLI interface and runtime.
* Fixed multiplication of strings by 0 that was not an empty string.
* Implicit import of the current package (e.g., `module foo.Bar` implicitly has a `import foo`).
* New `catcher` higher-order function.
* Print a warning when unable to load a class.
* Golodocs now have an index file.
* Fixed a bug on self reference in closures.
* The Golo source code is now compiled with the `javac -parameters` flag and with UTF-8 encoding.
* Issues in dealing with named parameters from Java classes have been fixed.
* Improvements to `DynamicObject`: new `kind` property to tag objects and a default `toString` method constructs a representation based on all properties values.
* The JavaCC / JJTree generated code has now been moved to `src/main/generated`.
* Golodoc now link to a HTML version of the corresponding source code elements.
* Misc fixes.
