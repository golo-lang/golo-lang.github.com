title: 'Golo news roundup #1'
---

Golo is less than a week old, but some crazy folks already did lots of funny things it seems!

This first news roundup is inspired by the [blog post (in French) from our most enthusiastic developer advocate](http://k33g.github.com/2013/04/02/GOLO.html) who doesn't seem to be sleeping at night: [Philippe Charriere](http://k33g.github.com/).

* Golo creator Julien Ponge [posted a note with some details behind the development of Golo](http://julien.ponge.org/notes/golo-story/). This should be interesting if you wonder why yet another language on the JVM emerged last week.

* Romain Lespinasse and Philippe Charri√®re have some help for Mac OS X users. [Romain wrote Homebrew formulas](https://github.com/rlespinasse/golo-on-osx) for both Golo and a helper script that Philippe wrote. Full support for Golo in Homebrew [will have to wait until we have stable releases](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/18768), but you can meanwhile install it [from Romain's Homebrew fork](https://github.com/rlespinasse/golo-on-osx#gogolo-formula).

* Thierry Chantier, another Golo Knight, played with [an HTTP server written in Golo](https://github.com/titimoby/GoloHttpServer).

* Philippe Charriere is having fun developing [a web framework in Golo called `fastforward`](http://k33g.github.com/fastforward/). While he clearly does this for his own educational purposes, it is quite fun to watch how he cleverly gets around the language design.

* Thierry Chantier [wrote a batch of introduction articles to Golo](http://titimoby.herokuapp.com/blog/categories/golo/). Those are short and clear articles, and hopefuly Thierry will post more of these!

* Philippe Charriere also wrote a batch of introduction articles, this time in French: [1](http://k33g.github.com/2013/03/28/GOLO.html), [2](http://k33g.github.com/2013/03/30/GOLO.html), [3](http://k33g.github.com/2013/03/31/GOLO.html) and [4](http://k33g.github.com/2013/04/02/GOLO.html). While Philippe shall use `let` rather than `var` more often, it gives French readers a good overview of the language, and Philippe's energy and style are hard to beat.

* Philippe Charriere launched a [community web site that references nano frameworks, samples and experiments with Golo](http://k33g.github.com/nano.golo/). It's hosted on GitHub, and you just have to make pull requests to point to your projects. Good news: Gists are more than welcome! It also features the [excellent testing DSL that David Gageot made](https://gist.github.com/dgageot/9895cbae5fbd70892d0d) (David, fancy a complete contribution?).

* Build master and continuous delivery wizard Henri Gomez is [pushing native RPM packages to BinTray](https://bintray.com/user/profile/hgomez). Thanks Henri!

* Romain Lespinasse [proposed the inclusion of Golo in GitHub](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/453), but the staff understandabily prefers waiting for the language to become more popular. Meanwhile we can note the *"Language looks cool."* sentence :-)

That's all and already much folks!

We will do our best to regularly push news roundups from the community. Because **you are the community**, feel-free to let us know what you did! (via twitter, email, issues, whatever)
