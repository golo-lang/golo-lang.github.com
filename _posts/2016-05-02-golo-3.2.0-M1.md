Sticking to the plan, here is the first milestone towards Eclipse Golo 3.2.0!

### What's new

* Upgraded to JCommander 1.55.
* Upgraded to ASM 5.1.
* A new `check` command has appeared: it applies all compilation checks to source files, which is useful for integrating with editors to provide integrated error reporting.
* `_` is now allowed in floating numbers and negative exponent with scientific notation.
* `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` now have a literal notation with the `_B` suffix, as in `123_B` or `123.5_B`.
* Operators have been extended to support `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` types.
