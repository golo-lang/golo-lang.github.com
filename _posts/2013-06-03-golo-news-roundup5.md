### What's new in Golo?

* We released `0-preview4` mid-May.

* The DynaMid members are busy writing research papers, including one on Golo, hence the slower development over the last 2 weeks. Be sure that we will get back to more *commit frenzy* as soon as we can!

* Julien Ponge has *in-development* branches in [his repository](https://github.com/jponge/golo-lang/):

    1. [`wip/golodoc`](https://github.com/jponge/golo-lang/tree/wip/golodoc) aims at providing support for documentation in Golo source code, in Markdown, and

    2. [`wip/dynamic-evaluation`](https://github.com/jponge/golo-lang/tree/wip/dynamic-evaluation) is experimenting with dynamic code evaluation.

### In the community

* Daniel Petisme [forked Groovy's GVM](https://github.com/danielpetisme/govm) to support Golo. This
opened interesting discussions between the authors of *GVM* and [jEnv](http://www.jenv.be), and they
may collaborate to provide a common solution for the JVM runtimes and languages, which would be just awesome!

* Philippe Charri√®re [will do a Golo talk at the Montpellier JUG](http://www.jug-montpellier.org/event/18).

### Looking for ways to contribute?

We are always looking for community contributions!

A good way to start is to [browse the open issues](https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang/issues?state=open).

Among those issues, there are 3 of them that may be easy if you are new to Golo.

1. [Reworking the command-line interface](https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang/issues/35) to support subcommands just like Git or Ceylon.

2. [Supporting underscores in number literals](https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang/issues/11) is a simple parser work.

3. Sylvain Desgrais [opened a pull request a while back for supporting native code in Golo](https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang/pull/7) a while back. You could help Sylvain as the feature is interesting but not finished yet.

Until next time, have fun with Golo and let us know the kind of fun things you are doing with it!
