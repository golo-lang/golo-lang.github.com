A bit more than one year after the last _official_ release, we are pleased to share with you Eclipse Golo 3.2.0!

### What's new

#### Golo 3.2.0-M1 (2016/05/02)

* Upgraded to JCommander 1.55.
* Upgraded to ASM 5.1.
* A new `check` command has appeared: it applies all compilation checks to source files, which is useful for integrating with editors to provide integrated error reporting.
* `_` is now allowed in floating numbers and negative exponent with scientific notation.
* `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` now have a literal notation with the `_B` suffix, as in `123_B` or `123.5_B`.
* Operators have been extended to support `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` types.

#### Golo 3.2.0-M2 (2016/06/13)

* Golodoc UX improvements.
* Support for unicode escaped chars in strings and chars literals.

#### Golo 3.2.0-M3 (2016/07/25)

* OSGi metadata is now generated again (using the corresponding Gradle plugin).
* New _shebang_ runtime support for running Golo as scripts.

#### Golo 3.2.0-M4 (2016/09/05)

* Bug fix for destructuring assignments inside closures.
* Switch to Gradle 3.0.
* Upgrade to a more recent version of JCommander.

#### Golo 3.2.0-M5 (2016/10/24)

(delayed to a further week due to a busy agenda)

* Anonymous calls refactorings on chained calls.
* Upgraded to Gradle 3.1.
* Bug: the compiler would hang on unassigned `var` declarations.
* Support for Java primitive types references (e.g., `long.class`).

#### Golo 3.2.0-M6 (2017/04/20)

* Multiple imports from the same statement, as in `import java.util.{Collections, Objects, stream.Collectors}`.
* Relative imports from the current module, as in `import .bar.Baz`.
* Misc improvements of the struct generated classes.
* Localisation in the compiler, CLI interface and runtime.
* Fixed multiplication of strings by 0 that was not an empty string.
* Implicit import of the current package (e.g., `module foo.Bar` implicitly has a `import foo`).
* New `catcher` higher-order function.
* Print a warning when unable to load a class.
* Golodocs now have an index file.
* Fixed a bug on self reference in closures.
* The Golo source code is now compiled with the `javac -parameters` flag and with UTF-8 encoding.
* Issues in dealing with named parameters from Java classes have been fixed.
* Improvements to `DynamicObject`: new `kind` property to tag objects and a default `toString` method constructs a representation based on all properties values.
* The JavaCC / JJTree generated code has now been moved to `src/main/generated`.
* Golodoc now link to a HTML version of the corresponding source code elements.
* Misc fixes.

#### Final version (2017/06/26)

* Dynamic objects trees from JSON text.
* `golo-debug` script to run a golo script in a debugger (jdb).
* Range object and conversion functions for `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`.
* Add a new `str` predefined method to help concatenating strings.
* The `golo new` command is improved, now having two different profiles, initializing the version control repository, and generating more file stubs.
* Refactoring of the way the golodoc is generated (use the IR instead of the AST).

### Special thanks

The original creator of Golo would like to thank Yannick Loiseau (now co-project lead), Sylvain Desgrais and Philippe Charri√®re for their amazing impact over the last year.

Thanks mates! :-)
