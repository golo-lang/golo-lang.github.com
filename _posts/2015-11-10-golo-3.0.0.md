Following the success of our [first release review](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.golo/reviews/3.0.0-incubation-release-review) at the Eclipse Foundation, we are very pleased to announce the availability of Golo Eclipse 3.0.0!

After 2 years of development under the sole stewardship of INSA-Lyon, we announced last April our
intention to make Golo an Eclipse Technology Project. The project entered incubation in June,
and since then we have made lots of progress on the code base and got up to speed with the Eclipse
development process.

### What's new

This release is a major change compared to Golo 2.1.0. The complete [new and noteworthy](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Golo/Roadmap-v3.0) list of changes is available from the Eclipse wiki, but here are the highlights:

* Support of Java 8
* Named arguments
* Union types
* Fixed _LL(k)_ parser for operators
* foreach loops with guard conditions
* Easier adapter generation API
* Extensible CLI subcommands
* Collection comprehensions, inspired by Python
* A switch to the Gradle build tool
* Simplified parser errors.
