We are pleased to announce the second preview release of Golo!

As you can expect, this release contains many bug fixes since we first made Golo available as an opensource project.

The notable lannguage changes are the following:

* the `augment` keyword replaces `pimp`,
* we introduced `continue` and `break` statements,
* `null`-safe method invocations are now possible using the *Elvis* symbol '`?:`',
* the `orIfNull` operator gives a default value when an expression evaluates to `null`.

Now is your turn, so please go ahead and:

* [Try Golo on Google AppEngine](http://golo-console.appspot.com/)
* [Download a preview release of Golo](/download/)
* [Read the Golo programming language guide](/documentation/next/)
* [Fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang)
