We are pleased to share the first milestone towards Golo 3.0.0. This milestone marks the first
result since our transition to the Eclipse Foundation.

The march towards a 3.0.0 release will comprise a yet undefined number of milestones.
As you can see on [our roadmap](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Golo/Roadmap-v3.0), we will make a new
milestone available every 6 weeks.

### What's new?

While we have been quite busy with the transition to Eclipse, this milestone still contains many changes
since version 2.1.0:

* JDK 8 is now required.
* Support for Java 8 lambdas / functional interfaces.
* Support for named arguments, leveraging JDK 8 bytecode metadata.
* New union types.
* Operators priorities and left-associativity have been fixed in the LL(k) parser.
* Augmentations can now define a fallback method.
* New lazy lists.
* foreach loops can now have a guard condition.
* Function references are now represented using FunctionReference rather than straight MethodHandle.
* Decorators can now change function arities.
* Deprecated array methods and functions have been removed.
* Easier adapters generation API.
* CLI subcommands are now defined through a SPI for modularity and extensibility.
* The `fun` function can now retrieve instance methods.
* Fixes in arithmetic comparison operators.
* Fixes in special character escaping in String and char literals.
* Documentation generation is now self-contained with Asciidoctor instead of Asciidoc.
