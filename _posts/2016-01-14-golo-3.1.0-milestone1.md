Happy new year everyone!

Here is the first milestone of Golo 3.1.0, and we have great changes to share with you.

### What's new?

* The new `gololang.Errors` modules provides functional error handling capabilities.
* An issue with named parameters and directly-called anonymous function references has been fixed.
* Duplicate `struct` and `union` types are now being detected as compilation errors.
* The `orIfNull` operator was incorrectly eager, it has now been made lazy.
* Overloaded instance methods from Java APIs are now supported, with proper call site invalidation. This augments the Golo to Java inter-operability.
* The runtime support for instance methods resolution has been refactored.
* A rare variable arguments matching issue has been fixed.
* Augmentations are now also resolved based on the call stack, so that a calling module also offers its visible augmentations as a fallback.
* Operator call sites now use an exception-based invalidation mechanism rather that a guard-based one.
* Structures are now comparable.
* Issues when mixing module state and closure state have been addressed.
* A new console ANSI codes module is part of the standard API.
* Custom factory functions can now be defined for structures.
* Implicit modules are now imported after the explicit ones.
* The compiler intermediate representation API has been refactored.
